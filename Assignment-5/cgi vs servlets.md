## CGI (Common Gateway Interface) vs Servlets
# Aspect =>	
CGI (Common Gateway Interface) whereas Servlets (Java-based).

# Definition =>	
CGI is a standard interface for web servers to execute programs that generate dynamic content, whereas Servlets are Java-based technology to extend the capabilities of servers by handling requests and generating responses.


# Language Support => 
CGI	Supports languages like Perl, Python, C, etc, whereas Servlets are	Java-based only.


# Performance =>	
CGI is slower due to process creation for each request, whereas Servlets are	faster as it runs in the same JVM, reusing threads for requests.


# Resource Usage => 
CGI requires	high memory and CPU usage due to process forking, whereas Servlets requires	low memory footprint, efficient multi-threaded handling.


# Scalability =>	
CGI is not scalable for high-traffic applications, whereas Servlets are	highly scalable, suitable for enterprise applications.


# Error Handling =>	
CGI has limited error handling capabilities, whereas Servlets have	advanced error handling with Java exceptions.


# Security => 
CGI is	less secure, requires careful coding, whereas Servlets are	more secure with Javaâ€™s security features.


## Advantages of Servlets over CGI:
Higher performance due to multi-threading.

Better resource management as it avoids process creation for each request.

Platform-independent (runs on any server with Java support).

Simpler error handling and debugging.
